# Adjusted as needed

# Project docker compose file to start up postgres.
#
# 1. Set the postgres variables in proj.env
# 2. Update load-extensions.sh to create the extensions you want loaded
# 3. Upon running for the first time, the container will be created and the database initialized
# 4. Subsequent times you run, the database will already be initialized
# 5. Deleting the container removes the content
#
#
#  To run in the foreground (easiest)
#  > docker-compose up
#
#  To run in the background and tail the logs
#  > docker-compose up -d
#  > docker-compose logs -f
#
#  Subsequent builds (if you change Dockerfile)
#  > docker-compose build
#
